Count I - Infringement of the '707 Patent
13. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the foregoing allegations.
14.
This case concerns automobiles retrofitted with Defendant's aftermarket driver
15. The Accused Vehicles meet the limitations of claim 20 of the '707 Patent at least assistance kit ("the Accused Vehicles").
as follows:
a. Claim 6, from which claim 20 indirectly depends, describes "[a] vehicle." The Accused Vehicles are vehicles, specifically, automobiles.
b. The vehicle in claim 6 comprises "a factory-installed first apparatus configured to generate an electrical signal." The Accused Vehicles include such a factory-installed first apparatus, for example, in the form of a radar sensor or an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) camera.
C. The vehicle in claim 6 further comprises "a factory-installed second apparatus configured to receive the electrical signal." The Accused Vehicles include this second apparatus, for example, in the form of a power steering control module or a powertrain control module.
d. The vehicle in claim 6 further comprises "a retrofit apparatus electrically connected to the factory-installed second apparatus." In the Accused Vehicles, this retrofit apparatus includes, for example, a "Comma 2" or "Comma 3" module and other components (collectively referred to as the "comma.ai devkit" or "devkits") that are electrically connected to the factory-installed second apparatus.
e. Claim 6 requires that "the retrofit apparatus generates a mimicked electrical signal independently of the electrical signal generated by the factory-installed first apparatus." In
3
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 4
the Accused Vehicles, the comma.ai devkit generates mimicked electrical signals in the form of CAN messages. These CAN messages include, for example, control messages that mimic CAN messages related to the vehicle's "Adaptive Cruise Control" and "Automated Lane Centering (ALC)." For example, the mimicked CAN messages include a vehicle acceleration CAN message or equivalent message. The mimicked CAN messages are generated independently of the CAN messages generated by the factory-installed first apparatus, i.e., independently of signals generated by the vehicle's original hardware.
f. Claim 6 requires that the "factory-installed second apparatus receives the mimicked electrical signal." In the Accused Vehicles, the factory-installed second apparatus, e.g., the power steering control module or the powertrain control module, receives the mimicked signals generated by the comma.ai devkit.
g. Claim 18, from which claim 20 indirectly depends, requires that "the retrofit apparatus includes an electronically controlled switch to selectively separate a direct electrical connection between the factory-installed first apparatus and the factory-installed second apparatus." Claim 19, from which claim 20 depends, further defines this electronically controlled switch to be a relay. In the Accused Vehicles, the comma.ai devkit includes a relay. h. Claim 20 requires that "the relay is selectively controlled in response to a presence of an electrical failure." In the Accused Vehicles, the comma.ai devkit is programmed to control the relay in response to recognizing, for example, a loss of communication between components within the Comma 2 / Comma 3 module.
16. Defendant has directly infringed and, on information and belief, is now directly infringing, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, claim 20 of the '707 Patent by making,
4
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 5
using, offering to sell, or selling in the United States, or importing into the United States, one or more Accused Vehicles.
17. Further, on information and belief, Defendant has induced infringement and is now inducing infringement of claim 20 of the '707 Patent.
18. More specifically, at least since June 16, 2022, Defendant has been aware of the '707 Patent and has known that making or using Accused Vehicles infringes claim 20 of the '707 Patent.
19. Defendant actively encourages infringement by selling comma.ai devkits to others with instructions for installing and using them in automobiles and publishing online instructions and video tutorials showing how to install and use comma.ai devkits in automobiles.
20. On information and belief, customers have used Defendant's instructions to make and use Accused Vehicles as a result of Defendant's acts of inducement.
21. Further, on information and belief, Defendant has contributorily infringed and is now contributorily infringing claim 20 of the '707 Patent.
22. More specifically, at least since June 16, 2022, Defendant has been aware of the '707 Patent and has known that making or using Accused Vehicles infringes claim 20 of the '707 Patent.
23. On information and belief, customers have since that time purchased devkits, have used them to make Accused Vehicles, and have used the Accused Vehicles they made.
24. The devkit is a material part of the Accused Vehicles and has no substantial non-
infringing uses.
25. As a result of Defendant's infringement of the '707 Patent, Plaintiff has suffered damages.
5
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 6
26. Defendant sells Accused Vehicles and/or devkits used to make Accused Vehicles.
27. Further, comma.ai collects data from Accused Vehicles and sells or offers to sell such data to third parties.
28. On information and belief, Defendant earns substantial sums from such sales.
29. Plaintiff is entitled to a money judgment in an amount adequate to compensate for Defendant's infringement since it first had notice of the '707 Patent, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.
30. Furthermore, despite Defendant's knowledge of the '707 Patent and its infringement, Defendant has, on information and belief, continued to infringe the '707 Patent.
31. Accordingly, on information and belief, Defendant's infringement has been and is willful, thus entitling Plaintiff to enhanced (treble) damages.
Count II - Infringement of the '116 Patent
1
32. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the foregoing allegations.
33. As noted above, the Accused Vehicles incorporate comma.ai's devkits, including the comma three devkit (the "Accused Kits").
34. The Accused Kits meet the limitation of claim 1 of the '116 Patent at least as follows:
a. Claim 1 describes "[a] retrofit apparatus for installation in an existing vehicle." Defendant's devkits are aftermarket driver assistance kits ("retrofit apparatuses") that are installed in existing vehicles.
b. The apparatus in claim 1 comprises "a control processor." The Accused Kit includes a module with a STM32H725 control processor.
6
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 7
c. The apparatus in claim 1 further comprises "a first vehicle data bus terminal for electrically connecting the retrofit apparatus to a first factory-installed apparatus." The Accused Kit includes a connector with terminals, including a first vehicle data bus terminal for electrically connecting the comma three devkit to the vehicle's factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module (the "first factory-installed apparatus").
d. The apparatus in claim 1 further comprises "a second vehicle data bus terminal for electrically connecting the retrofit apparatus to a second factory-installed apparatus." The Accused Kit includes a connector that has a second vehicle data bus terminal for electrically connecting the devkit to a factory-installed camera and/or radar sensor (the "second factory- installed apparatus").
e. . The apparatus in claim 1 further comprises "an electromechanical relay operatively connected to and controlled by the control processor, the relay being configured to selectively connect the first vehicle data bus terminal to the second vehicle data bus terminal." The Accused Kit includes an electromechanical relay operatively connected to and controlled by the STM32H725 control processor. The relay is configured to selectively connect the first vehicle data bus terminal to the second vehicle data bus terminal in response to certain occurrences.
f. Claim 1 requires that "an original data bus message originating in the second factory-installed apparatus reaches the first factory-installed apparatus when the relay connects the first vehicle data bus terminal to the second vehicle data bus terminal." In "passthrough mode," the relay in the Accused Kit directly connects the vehicle's factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module (the "first factory-installed apparatus") to the vehicle's factory-installed camera and/or radar sensor (the "second factory- installed apparatus"). In passthrough mode, an original data bus message originating in the factory-
7
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 8 of 10 PageID #: 8
installed camera and/or radar sensor reaches the factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module.
g Claim 1 requires that "the original data bus message originating in the second factory-installed apparatus does not reach the first factory-installed apparatus when the relay disconnects the first vehicle data bus terminal from the second vehicle data bus terminal." When the Accused Kit operates with its OpenPilot feature active, the relay directly disconnects the vehicle's factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module (the "first factory-installed apparatus") from the vehicle's factory-installed camera and/or radar sensor (the "second factory-installed apparatus"). When OpenPilot is active, an original data bus message originating in the factory-installed camera and/or radar sensor does not reach the factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module.
h Claim 1 requires that "the retrofit apparatus transmits a mimicked data bus message to the first factory-installed apparatus." When OpenPilot is active, the Accused Kit transmits mimicked data bus messages to the factory-installed power steering control module or powertrain control module (the "first factory-installed apparatus"). For example, the mimicked data bus messages include a vehicle acceleration CAN message or equivalent message.
35. Defendant has directly infringed and, on information and belief, is now directly infringing, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, at least claim 1 of the '116 Patent by making, using, offering to sell, or selling in the United States, or importing into the United States, one or more Accused Kits.
36. As a result of Defendant's infringement of the '116 Patent, Plaintiff has suffered damages.
37. Defendant sells Accused Kits and/or vehicles incorporating Accused Kits.
8
Case 1:22-cv-01105-UNA Document 1 Filed 08/23/22 Page 9 of 10 PageID #: 9
38. Further, comma.ai collects data from Accused Kits and sells or offers to sell such data to third parties.
39. On information and belief, Defendant earns substantial sums from such sales.
40. Plaintiff is entitled to a money judgment in an amount adequate to compensate for Defendant's infringement since it first had notice of the '116 Patent, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.
41. Furthermore, despite Defendant's knowledge of the '116 Patent and its infringement, Defendant has, on information and belief, continued to infringe the '116 Patent.
42. Accordingly, on information and belief, Defendant's infringement has been and is willful, thus entitling Plaintiff to enhanced (treble) damages.
JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

When the emergency call push button switch is dial command message including a telephone number to be dialed on the vehicle data bus. The telecommunication apparatus is configured to receive the telephone dial com- mand and establish communication with the requested tele- Safety Answering Point in the United States the emergency call apparatus may e.g. transmit a telephone dial command message requesting the telecommunication apparatus to dial "911".
An emergency call to the service provider may also be initiated automatically, e.g. upon airbag deployment.
In case of an incoming emergency call the mobile appli- cation service center silently obtains vehicle position infor-
mation, e.g. information from a GPS receiver that is also 25 phone number. To initiate an emergency call to a Public
